            I began baking last year after attending a Baking Bootcamp at Bettie's in Chicago. Since then I have been obsessed with baking cookies and bread. Other baked goods are still a bit out of my league. Click on the pictures below to find the my favorite recipes.

            I began crocheting after taking a beginner crochet class at Sister-Arts Studio in Chicago. While I have been crocheting for a little of a year, I am still very much a beginner. See the pictures below to see some of the things I've made!

    <p>I have always loved reading and now am lucky enough to get to teach others how to read! See below for a few of my favorite books, old and new!</p>
    <ul>
        <li> <a>The Lincoln Highway by Amor Towles</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>My favorite Amor Towles book! Two brothers embark on a road trip across America dreaming of a grand future but end up on a journey of self-discovery. </li>
            </ul>
        <li> <a> The Day the Crayons Quit by Drew Daywalt</a> </li>
            <ul>
                <li>My favorite children's book. Duncan's crayons go on strike! Each crayon writes a letter outlining their grievances. P.S. A bit long for one read aloud, best to split into two days :) </li>
            </ul>
        <li> <a> The Fellowship of Puzzlemakers by Samuel Burr</a></li>
            <ul> 
                <li>A lighthearted read about a baby left on the steps of an unorthodox group of puzzle fanatics. Full of fun riddles, puzzles, and an emphasis on building relationships!</li>
            </ul>
        <li> <a> Nothing to See Here by Kevin Wilson</a></li>
            <ul> 
                <li>A coming of age book about teenagers testing limits and finding themselves, with a hint of mystery. A quick relatable read! </li>
            </ul>
    </ul>
